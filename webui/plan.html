<h3>Course building planning</h3>

<p>Week by week:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="doneItem"><strong>Feb 25~28</strong>: Gone researching for a
    usable training platform. 
    <p>We <em>need</em> a platform in order to </p>
    <ul>
      <li>normalize training format (introducing the less possible
      restrictions)</li>
      <li>keep track of student's actions (what parts of the course they used,
        when, for how long), </li>
      <li>to keep track of grading actions like quizzes and exams, </li>
      <li>to be able to automate exams and immediately return the result to the
        student, </li>
      <li>to control course dependencies, ... </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Achievements: </p>
    <p>Moodle is succesfully installed and running, and we have a step-by-step
    guide to repeat the installation. <a href="moodleNotes.html">See the
    notes</a>. </p>
    <p>Also, Moodle was succesfully discarded. It suffers from two main issues:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>It's outdated. It's request-response cycles with whole pege refresh
        are so 1999, and</li>
      <li>The UI is terrible. Having globers create and take courses on suan a
        UI means assuming a recurrent extra-cost, as compared to doing the same
        on a usable UI that I haven't identified yet. </li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
  </li>
  <li class="doneItem"><strong>Mar 5~7 (3 days)</strong>: Assess the available
    course material in the Web UI track by 
    <ul>
      <li>taking all exams</li>
      <li>accessing and partially reading the current course material </li>
      <li>taking notes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The purpose is to rescue the valuable parts of what we already have
    (maybe fixing a few issues)</p>
    <p>Done: </p>
    <p>This 3-days week was an insights week. </p>

    <h4>Exams</h4>
    <p>Firstly, I realized that we need good exams better than courses. For the
    Globant's purpose it doesn't matter what the globers do but what do they
    know. </p>
    <p>Moreover, we'd like to assess the globers knowledge in an unbiased way,
    independent of the varying levels of self-esteem. </p>

    <h4>Tracks</h4>
    <p>As an initial approach, a <em>learning track</em> on a subject is a tree
    of exams (minicerts) where the glober starts at the root and has to move to
    the branches and the leaves. </p>
    <p>The globers advance by approving exams. We don't care that much about
    how they acquired the knowledge; we yes care about having good exams
    allowing us to assert the globers level. </p>
    <p>Actually, a glober that knows it all can blaze the trail from start to
    end in a few hours just by approving all its exams. </p>
    <p>So a track is its exams, and for each one a set of suggestions on how to
    get the knowledge needed to approve it. </p>
    <p>The exams are organized hierarchically: to be able to take a test the
    globers must have approved al its <em>dependencies</em>. </p>

    <h4>Course materials</h4>
    <p>The exams approach doesn't mean that we won't develop any courses. It
    means that for each leap we'll do some scouting in order to find
    appropriate trainings, and if there are not then we'll have to make our own
    course. </p>
    <p>As much as we can, we'll cater from the public courses offering from
    first class universities. </p>

    <h4>Additional knowledge</h4>
    <p>For example, the course "M101J: MongoDB for Java Developers" is starting
    by Mar 17, 2014. By March 27 there will be a course for node.js developers
    and another for DBAs. These are 5 hours per week courses that span about 8
    weeks. </p>
    <p>Amazon is offering their "AWS Partner Webinars". </p>
    <p>Depending on what we expect to be requested by our clients we could be
    building knowledge since today, allowing the globers to take the lengthy
    courses like Mongo's as a part-time additional activity, that can be used
    to neasure the glober's curiosity and interest. </p>

    <h4>Exams creation</h4>
    <p>We should have a means to create good online exams and to allow the
    globers to take them and know the result immediately. In order to mantain
    integrity, the exams system must enforce dependencies and block repeated
    attempts on a single test, like for example by forcing a one-week wait. </p>

    <h4>Achieved:</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Firstly, after thinking a lot, it became clear thet we need exams
        better than courses. 
        <p>We want to measure the globers' knowledge. We don't care about how
        they achieved a knowledge level, just want to assess that level. </p>
        <p>Thus, our priority should be the development of good exams rather
        then courses. </p>
      </li>
      <li>To make the globers progress in their knowledge on common subjects,
        like basic web development, we can point the globers to some of the
        many good courses available for free in the Internet. 
        <p>There is, for example, this "<a
        href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-cs046">Intro to
        programming</a>" course that seems very effective in that it does not
        bugs the students with theory but instead goes right to coding and
        running Java programs. </p>
        <p>For the Web UI track there is "<a
        href="https://www.udemy.com/learn-html5-programming-from-scratch/">Learn
        HTML5 Programming From Scratch</a>". It starts from zero and includes
        the newer technologies. </p>
        <p>I'm taking those two courses in full, in order to check their level
        and how do they fit our purpose. </p>
      </li>
      <li>Additionally, I started a mockup for the exams UI, as a personal
        initiative. All the exams thing must function automatically, for better
        servicing its purpose and saving on manpower on an ongoing fashion. 
        <p>For example I took two Web UI exams and got no feedback. This is
        discouraging for the student. </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Mar 10~14</strong>: Create the scheleton of a renewed Web UI
    track: 
    <ul>
      <li class="doneItem">Define explicitly the purpose</li>
      <li class="doneItem">Define explicitly the intended target</li>
      <li>Enumerate the syllabus items </li>
      <li>Split in weekly minicerts</li>
      <li>With assesment capabilities</li>
      <li>Automating quizzes</li>
      <li>Filter out the absolute beginners by redirecting them to a basic
        course elsewhere, request a statement of acomplishment to the student
        if available (outsourcing!) </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
