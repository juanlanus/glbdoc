NAME
     msg.h, msg - message queue structures

SYNOPSIS
     #include <sys/msg.h>

DESCRIPTION
     The <sys/msg.h> header  defines  the  following  data  types
     through typedef:

     msgqnum_t       used for the number of messages in the  mes-
                     sage queue

     msglen_t        used for the number of bytes allowed in  the
                     message queue

     These types are unsigned integer  types  that  are  able  to
     store values at least as large as a type unsigned short.

     The <sys/msg.h> header defines the following constant  as  a
     message operation flag:

     MSG_NOERROR     no error if big message

     The msqid_ds structure contains the following members:

     struct ipc_perm    msg_perm      Operation permission structure.
     msgqnum_t          msg_qnum      Number of messages currently on queue.
     msglen_t           msg_qbytes    Maximum number of bytes allowed on queue.
     pid_t              msg_lspid     Process ID of last msgsnd(2).
     pid_t              msg_lrpid     Process ID of last msgrcv(2).
     time_t             msg_stime     Time of last msgsnd().
     time_t             msg_rtime     Time of last msgrcv().
     time_t             msg_ctime     Time of last change.

     The pid_t, time_t, key_t,  size_t,  and  ssize_t  types  are
     defined as described in <sys/types.h>. See types(3HEAD).

NAME
     write - write to another user

SYNOPSIS
     write user [terminal]

DESCRIPTION
     The write utility reads lines from the user's standard input
     and  writes them to the terminal of another user. When first
     invoked, it writes the message:

     Message from sender-login-id (sending-terminal) [date]...

     to user. When it has successfully completed the  connection,
     the sender's terminal will be alerted twice to indicate that
     what  the  sender  is  typing  is  being  written   to   the
     recipient's terminal.

     If the recipient wants to reply, this can be accomplished by
     typing

     write sender-login-id [sending-terminal]

     upon receipt of the initial  message.  Whenever  a  line  of
     input as delimited by a NL, EOF, or EOL special character is
     accumulated while in canonical input mode,  the  accumulated
     data  will  be written on the other user's terminal. Charac-
     ters are processed as follows:

       +o  Typing the alert character will write the alert charac-
          ter to the recipient's terminal.

       +o  Typing the erase and kill characters  will  affect  the
          sender's  terminal  in  the  manner  described  by  the
          termios(3C) interface.

       +o  Typing the interrupt  or  end-of-file  characters  will
          cause  write  to write an appropriate message (EOT\n in
          the "C" locale) to the recipient's terminal and exit.

       +o  Typing characters from LC_CTYPE  classifications  print
          or  space will cause those characters to be sent to the
          recipient's terminal.

       +o  When and only  when  the  stty  iexten  local  mode  is
--More--(26%)          enabled,  additional  special  control  characters  and
          multi-byte or single-byte characters are  processed  as
          printable    characters   if   their   wide   character
          equivalents are printable.

       +o  Typing other non-printable characters will  cause  them
          to  be  written to the recipient's terminal as follows:

SunOS 5.10           Last change: 3 Nov 2000                    1

User Commands                                            write(1)

          control characters will appear as a `^' followed by the
          appropriate  ASCII  character,  and characters with the
          high-order bit set will appear in "meta" notation.  For
          example,  `\003'  is  displayed  as  `^C' and `\372' as
          `M-z'.

     To write to a user who is logged in more than once, the ter-
     minal  argument  can  be  used to indicate which terminal to
     write to. Otherwise, the recipient's terminal is  the  first
     writable  instance  of the user found in /usr/adm/utmpx, and
     the following informational message will be written  to  the
     sender's  standard  output,  indicating  which  terminal was
     chosen:

     user is logged on more than one place.
     You are connected to terminal.
     Other locations are:terminal

     Permission to be a recipient  of  a  write  message  can  be
     denied  or  granted  by  use of the mesg utility. However, a
     user's privilege may further constrain the domain of  acces-
     sibility  of  other users' terminals. The write utility will
     fail when the user lacks the appropriate privileges to  per-
     form the requested action.

     If the character ! is found at  the  beginning  of  a  line,
     write  calls  the shell to execute the rest of the line as a
     command.

     write runs setgid() (see setuid(2)) to the group ID tty,  in
     order to have write permissions on other user's terminals.

     The following protocol is suggested for  using  write:  when
     you first write to another user, wait for them to write back
     before starting to send. Each person should  end  a  message
     with  a  distinctive  signal  (that is, (o) for ``over'') so
--More--(59%)     that the other person knows when to reply. The  signal  (oo)
     (for  ``over and out'') is suggested when conversation is to
     be terminated.

OPERANDS
     The following operands are supported:

     user            User (login) name of the person to whom  the
                     message  will  be written. This operand must
                     be of the form returned by the who(1)  util-
                     ity.
